<p>Testing 1, 2, 3... Is anyone out there? Hello to anyone reading this and welcome to this blog. I intend to write here semi-regularly covering various topics in the data science space, as well as deep learning.</p>
<p>I am a data scientist at an FTSE 100 company, and do lots of various things covering a wide range of data science techniques but not so much deep learning.</p>
<p>I really enjoy deep learning and as you can see in the past I have done some projects in the past using deep learning techniques, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jc639/pytorch-handwritingCTC">handwriting recognition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jc639/pytorch-CharRNN">character RNN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jc639/album-genre-predictions">album cover genre image recognition</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But I want to do more stuff regularly and plan to use this blog to do that. The writing here will be a consolidation of any learning and is mainly for me, but if anyone else finds it useful that is great!</p>
