I am a data scientist at a FTSE 100 company. This blog represents my personal opinions and musings on data science. 

I decided to start blogging after completing the fastai deep learning course, where they suggest writing can help you solidify your learnings. Two reasons given for starting a blog stood out to me:
* "It's like a resume but better!"
* "Helps you learn"

I am keenly interested in deep learning but don't get much opportunity to apply the skills I learn at my job unfortunately. I want to use this blog to help with learning but also document those skills that might not be evident from my CV. If someone finds something useful that I have written as part of that, then that's great!
