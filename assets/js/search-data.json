I intend to write here semi-regularly covering various topics in the data science space, as well as deep learning. . I am a data scientist at an FTSE 100 company, and do lots of various things covering a wide range of data science techniques but not so much deep learning. . I really enjoy deep learning and as you can see in the past I have done some projects in the past using deep learning techniques, such as: . handwriting recognition | character RNN | album cover genre image recognition | . But I want to do more stuff regularly and plan to use this blog to do that. The writing here will be a consolidation of any learning and is mainly for me, but if anyone else finds it useful that is great! .",

I decided to start blogging after completing the fastai deep learning course, where they suggest writing can help you solidify your learnings. Two reasons given for starting a blog stood out to me: . “It’s like a resume but better!” | “Helps you learn” | . I am keenly interested in deep learning but don’t get much opportunity to apply the skills I learn at my job unfortunately. I want to use this blog to help with learning but also document those skills that might not be evident from my CV. If someone finds something useful that I have written as part of that, then that’s great! .",
